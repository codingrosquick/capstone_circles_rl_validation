TODOLIST -> SERVER FLASK


    0 - SETUP SIMPLE SERVER

######### - Add routes template to call python scripts
-> start with the file exploration functionnalities
    - take arguments from POST request with Flask
    - init local cache at the end of creation
    
    - find a way to handle the async issue ??? resolve the installation issue

    - afterwards, extends this into routes (the index file), controllers and services
    - add possibility to delete such runs (careful)

    Caching (several places and cleans for those), add some logging
    + files architecture 


    1 - First functionnalities
